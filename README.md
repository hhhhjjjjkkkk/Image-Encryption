**Abstract**: This paper proposes a 3D model encryption scheme based on chaotic system, which adopts the scrambling-diffusion approach. First, we sorted and scrambled the plaintext data and added random points to confuse the plaintext data. The integer part of the floating point data is then XOR-encrypted, the fractional part is only scrambled, and iterated multiple times to achieve the process of fast encryption. The experimental results and security analysis show that the scheme has a large key space, is sensitive to keys and plaintext data, and can resist common attacks, so the encryption effect is good.

**Keywords**:Chaos theory; 3D model; scrambling-diffusion; floating point data.
